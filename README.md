# PhysioLive: A Wireless Physiotherapy Monitoring System

PhysioLive is an open-source project aimed at creating a wireless system for physiotherapy patient monitoring. The system focuses on tracking exercises and reporting movement or vital data in real time, aiming to improve both patient outcomes and therapeutic efficiency.

## Features 
1. Wireless Monitoring: Collects patient movement and/or health parameters remotely.

2. Physiotherapy Support: Designed specifically to assist physiotherapists and patients during rehabilitation sessions.

3. Data Logging: Records and stores relevant exercise and physiological data for progress tracking.

4. Web Interface: May include a dashboard for visualizing sessions, tracking patient improvement, and managing protocols.

5. Python/HTML/CSS Stack: Core logic written in Python, with frontend components in HTML and CSS.


## How It Works 

1. Sensors record patient movements and/or vital signs during physiotherapy.

2. Data is logged wirelessly to a central system.

3. Web dashboard displays session data and progress for practitioners and patients.

4. Supports personalized exercise plans and rehabilitation routines.
